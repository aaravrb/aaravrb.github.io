After having a few months of spare time, I decided to sharpen some skills that would be useful in engineering, and thus began building a foundation in CAD and my journey into mechanical design, I independently completed a structured online Fusion 360 course. This provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the core principles, from sketching and constraints to 3D modeling and assembly. I immediately applied this new knowledge to a hands-on project: designing a piston from the ground up. The process involved creating precise dimensional sketches, using extrusion tools to form its basic geometry, and applying fillets to its edges, which served as a practical and challenging introduction to bringing a digital concept to life.
